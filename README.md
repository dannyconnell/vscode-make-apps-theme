## About This Theme

This theme is based on the [Hybrid Next Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wyze.theme-hybrid-next&ssr=false#overview) by [Neil Kistner](https://github.com/wyze) which is based on the original [Hybrid Next Theme for Atom](https://github.com/kaicataldo/hybrid-next-syntax) by [Kai Cataldo](https://github.com/kaicataldo).

I've only made minor changes to the syntax highlighting, but have made many changes to the UI elements (activity bar, side bar, panels etc) to give the theme a more cohesive look & feel.
